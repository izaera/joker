# joker
Joker is (will be) a language based operating system where everything is written in Javascript.

This is a crazy experiment for re-learning how to do an operating system. I chose Javascript because it is the last
language in the world that anyone would use to develop an operating system. Thus I'm a pioneer :'-D.

Note to forkers: I'm forcing pushes to master at the beginning, so expect some history rewrites. I do this mainly
for backup purposes (I feel nervous if I only have a local copy). Once I stabilize things, I will rewrite history
one more time to polish it (and the WIP commit will disappear) and I won't force pushes again.

Have fun.
